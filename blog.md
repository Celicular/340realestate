This **0.35-acre parcel** offers beautiful views of **Coral Bay Harbor**, the **Sir Francis Drake Channel**, the **British Virgin Islands**, and beyond.

The lot is located on **Bordeaux Mountain** and faces east. Access is relatively easy—drive up Route 108 from Coral Bay, take the second left, and the property will be on your left.
